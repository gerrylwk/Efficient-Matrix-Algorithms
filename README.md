# Efficient-Matrix-Algorithms
The goal of this project is to have a repository of algorithms that can be used to solve matrix operations of special matrices in a time 
and space efficient manner. So far this project covers 3 types of special matrices, lower hessenberg, upper hessenberg and tridiagonal 
matrices. Algorithms include conversion of a matrix to LU form, LU solver, Ax=b solver via partial pivoting(PP) or scaled partial 
pivoting(spp).
